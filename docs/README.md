## Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy describes how the YouTube Snapshot Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles your information.

**Information We Collect**\
The Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data. It operates solely within your browser and interacts only with the active YouTube video page.

**Permissions**\
The Extension requests the following permissions:
- **Storage**: This permission allows the extension to store user preferences for keyboard shortcuts and how snapshots are saved (to file or clipboard).
- **Host permissions for youtube.com**: This permission allows the extension to interact with the YouTube video player and enable the snapshot functionality.

**How We Use Information**\
The Extension uses the granted permissions solely to enable its core functionality: capturing a snapshot of the current YouTube video frame and saving it as an image file on your local device. No data is transmitted or stored outside of your browser.

**Third-Party Sharing**\
The Extension does not share any information with third-party services or websites.

**Data Security**\
Since the Extension does not collect or store any user data, there is no user data to secure. However, the Extension's code is regularly reviewed to ensure it functions as intended and does not pose any security risks.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**\
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be posted on the Extension's page on the Chrome Web Store.
