I want to add a new functionality without compromising any of the existing ones. Its is the ability to save a section of the youtube video as a 10fps gif. You already have the ability to save a frame as a snapshot. Essentially when the user presses 'p' on their keyboard, the extension should start recording the youtube video at 10fps and and stop when the user presses 'p' again. Try to follow the standards outlines in Google Developer guidelines. Make the code concise and only add or update comments. Use local copies of any external library that might be required in the application. Follow best practices.
